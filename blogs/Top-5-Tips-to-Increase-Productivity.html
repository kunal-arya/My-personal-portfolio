        <h2>1) stay in good company</h2> 
        <p>
            People will drag you here and there to make you do things you don't want to do. So if you stay in a company of people who code a lot or who are productive, automatically you will start doing something productive. Resistance to change will be less.
        </p>
        
        <h2>2) Work in Teams</h2>
         <p>
            Don't work alone. If you have someone who is working on some part of your project and you are working on the other part. You feel bad about letting that person down. In that case you will go ahead and keep working more.

            4) Understanding Lizard Brain Technique
        </h2> 
        <p>
            When you have to do lots of work, your brain start thinking that it's a lot of work and I don't know whether we will live through this work or not because our brain is program from centuries to conserve energy. So, whenever you want to do some work, your brain will think, If I spent energy on this, I might not survive. That's not true right now. We have abundance of food, safety, security but your brain thinks like that. Unless Flight or Fight, your brain doesn't want to do work. That's why you feel that initial nudge. That's why you don't feel lazy before exams because your brain treats it as an emergency. Understand this, you are not like that, it's your brain that is not letting you do the work. What you do is - you start with a small chunk of work , donâ€™t say today I code the entire project or something but start saying I write 5 or 10 lines of code today and when you start your work , you lizard brain will go away and then you can work as much as you can.
