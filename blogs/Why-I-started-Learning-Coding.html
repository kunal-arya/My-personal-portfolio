        <h1>Why I started Learning Coding?</h1>
        <p>
            Hi , I am kunal , 24 years Old , completed my Post Graduation in July 2021 , working as a Business Development Executive in a company. </p>
        <p>
            So, I am not going to bore you with more details. Let's Start with the story.
        </p>
        <p>
            Story started around February month when I discover a great personality - Varun Mayya , well He is the youngest entrepreneur in India that got his funding from a VC for his Startup.
        </p>
        <p>
            Learnt a lot of things about business and all from him but one thing that he kept on repeating was to learn code because code is the future and I don't know but I might have a mental blockage that I am from commerce stream and coding is for B tech guys.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a one Fine day , I was Listening to an podcast "The Ranveer Show" and in that particular episode guest was "Sahil Lavingia" , he is also a Software Engineer and an Entrepreneur. In that episode of the podcast , He told a thing that stick with me , He said and I quote "In a lot of career Paths , you have to either get a certification or a degree , you have to go through some kind of path whereas with software, It is one of the few things where a path doesn't matter , If you can make something good , people will pay you money for it".
        </p>
        <p>
            So , I thought Why not give it a try , maybe I was able to make something good. If you don't know me , I just want you to know that I am the Guy who had tried lot of things like learning Digital Marketing , Done a Startup , learning Video Editing and do some little freelance work also in that , learning Shopify and e-commerce Industry and made some facebook ads for my clients and much more. So , in short I like to try lot of things because I feel that 20s are to trying different things. you don't really know where you want to go unless you have tried multiple things.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, this is the second phase of the story where I found another Great personality - Tanay Pratap, software Engineer at Microsoft. I found him because of Varun Mayya , so a big thank to him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tanay is a great software developer , he also runs a coding Bootcamp Neog camp that I came to know about early in June, 2021. He teaches students everything about coding for 6 months and then also get them placed in great Startups with packages that you can say IITan's got.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, like I said I have done MBA in Finance ( Financial analysis to be specific ) , but I really don't like my field that much. I feel stuck somehow, that is why I want to give coding a try and let's see what will happen in future. Btw, I am a computer Geek , so maybe coding is something I can do for my whole Life.
        </p>
        <p>
            But there are 2 issues with that coding bootcamp. First, It was done once a year and seats are limited and first come first serve bases. Second, you can't get your way in just by giving money. you first have to do 15 small assignments and after that there will be a interview and then after that you got selected.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have Completed my 15 small assignments and now I have Started my preparations for the Interview.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, This is how I have started my coding journey, Hope you will start your own journey at your own field or maybe in coding
        </p>

            I am going to share my journey on LinkedIn and twitter so please follow me for more update.
